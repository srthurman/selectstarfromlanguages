</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Originally I planned on creating this blog as a Flask app, following the tutorial from <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Miguel Gringberg</a> (if you have ever even thought about Flask too hard, you know that name). A little more research on hosting blogs led me to the conclustion that a static blog generator would be a better choice. </p>
<p>I'm not going to go into much detail on the why's, but it came down to wanting something I could easily customize, with little overhead, and free hosting options. See some of the resources I list below for further discussion.</p>
<p>I chose Pelican since it is well documented, both officially and with blog posts from other users, and has many themes to choose from.</p>
<p>I'm going to go over how I set up this blog using Pelican and hosting on GitHub Pages, and detail some trouble spots I had. I hope you find it helpful if you run into similar problems.</p>
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>For reference, I'm running on linux. If you're running on Windows and run into trouble feel free to contact me. I started out on Windows and run it as my other OS.</p>
<p>If you don't already have pip installed, <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html">do that first</a>. You will need pip for any sort of Python development, not just this project.</p>
<p>Next, set up a virtual environment for your project (NOTE: The virtual environment isn't required, but strongly recommended). If you're not familiar with virtual environments, see <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">the docs</a> on how to install, or google until you find a tutorial that makes sense to you.</p>
<p>Here's how I did it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>~<span class="nv">$ </span>virtualenv ~/python/virtualenvs/selectstarblog
~<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/python/virtualenvs/selectstarblog
~/python/virtualenvs/selectstarblog<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source </span>bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>selectstarblog<span class="o">)</span>~/python/virtualenvs/selectstarblog<span class="nv">$ </span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here's what's happening line by line:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up a directory to hold the files for this blog. The directory does not need to exist already.</li>
<li>Moving into that directory, since that's where I'll be working.</li>
<li>Activating the directory. That means it's live, and all installs I do only affect this directory.</li>
<li>Here's what your command line should look like once you've activated your virtual environment.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installing Pelican</h2>
<p>Installing is as easy as <code>pip install pelican</code>. You will see a lot of other libraries being installed as well, since pelican has a number of dependencies.</p>
<p>Next run <code>pelican-quickstart</code> to get the basic structure of your site set up. You will be asked a series of questions. I used the default for most of them (in the case of y/n questions, the default is capitalized), except for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to specify a URL prefix? (Y/n) n</li>
<li>Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages (y/N) y</li>
</ul>
<p>I left the default for 'Is this your personal page (username.github.io)? (y/N)' since I'm running this site as a project page.</p>
<p>you should have the following files and directories in your folder now</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>bin
content
develop_server.sh
fabfile.py
include
lib
local
Makefile
output
pelicanconf.py
publishconf.py
</pre></div>


<p>I decided to use markdown for writing the blog, so my final setup was running <code>pip install markdown</code>. If you want to use reStructuredText (.rst) then you don't need to install anything else.</p>
