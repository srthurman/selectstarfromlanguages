              <p>Keeping focused is something I've put real thought and energy into, as I'm inclined to get distracted by all the myriad things the world, and the internet, has to offer. The good news is you can improve your focus through practice. Though it's a continuing effort, and different techniques work for different people, here are a few tactics that have worked well for me.</p>
<h2>When working from home</h2>
<p>I've been working from home at least once a week for the past two years. Remote work has a lot of benefits, top among them being free from the distractions that come with being in an office full of people that may provide interruptions at any time. Being at home has it's own challenges too, and these tips are helpful with mitigating some of those.</p>
<h3>Put some clothes on</h3>
<p>You're likely not completely nude when working from home (no judgment if you are), but it's nice to not have to dress up. It can be tempting to stay in your PJs all day, but putting on real clothes can be very helpful in getting into a work mindset. If you're going to be at home all day, it's helpful to have some physical markers that you've transitioned from personal time to professional time.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't dress to the same degree I would need to at the office (shorts in summer!), but enough to take the dog out for a walk during lunch. </p>
<h3>Have a dedicated working space</h3>
<p>If you have the room, having a separate office is pretty ideal. Ok, ok, having a space just for work can be tough when you live in a moderate to small apartment. But it can be done! It's less about having a part of your place that is only used when working than having a specific set up you use when working.</p>
<p>For myself, I use this handy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sojitek-A-BLALARL01-FBA-Adjustable-Vented-Laptop/dp/B002LNVMIS/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438536187&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=folding+laptop+stand">adjustable laptop desk</a> set on a table, which brings the computer up to eye level, along with a wireless keyboard (brand withheld since it's fine, but I'm looking to upgrade) set on a box at a better level for typing and voila, my standing desk for working at home! It's not expensive, and I can store everything away when not in use. It goes back to physical markers that you're in work mode.</p>
<h2>General productivity</h2>
<h3>Make a list</h3>
<p>Let's start this section with the simplest but most powerful tip.</p>
<h3>Pomodoro tequnique</h3>
<p>You may have heard about the pomodoro technique before. If not, it really boils down to setting a timer for 25 minutes, focusing on whatever task you've designated for that time, and that task ONLY, and taking a 5 minute break when time's up. Repeat.</p>
<p>There are more nuances than that, but you can use it very effectively knowing only what I've told you above. I do! It's amazing how a simple thing like timing how long you will work on a task helps you push those other distractions out of your mind. You will have room to think about them in the 5 minutes after you're done working.</p>
<p>Being a person prone to distractions, sometimes an idea or thought about something unrelated pops up and I can't get it out of my mind to get back to the task at hand. In those instances, I just write it down. Groundbreaking advice, I know. But don't let the simplicity be off putting if you haven't tried it.</p>
<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<p>Listening to podcasts while working on something requiring a lot of brainpower would be distracting. But for good or bad, not everything we have to do at work requires us to exert our problem solving genius. Sometimes you have to do some tedious, less than mentally intensive work. In those instances, podcasts are a great way to pass the time, and depending on what you're listening to, it can feel more productive than the task at hand.</p>
<p>My favorite technical/work podcasts are <a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/">Talk Python to Me</a>, <a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/">JavaScript Jabber</a>, and <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast">Code Newbie</a>. For fun, <a href="http://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/">Stuff You Missed in History Class</a> and <a href="http://freakonomics.com/radio/freakonomics-radio-podcast-archive/">Freakonomics</a> are great (and you are still learning!).</p>
<h3>Close your windows</h3>
<p>Not your home or office windows (provided they open in the first place), but all that extra stuff you might be keeping up that don't relate to what you're trying to accomplish in this moment. So your to-do list for the day includes debugging some Java code, writing SQL to update a table, and proof reading some documentation? You don't need to open it all first thing. Really, you don't. I used to do that in lieu of making a list at the start of the day, and would constantly find myself switching gears mentally because I accidentally clicked on the window I need for the later task, but now that it's in front of me, maybe I'll try diving in.</p>
<p>E-mail is the biggest culprit for me - I usually restrict myself to checking it during those 5 minute breaks in the pomodoro routine, unless I'm waiting for something urgent (which is rare, since anything that urgent will probably involve a phone call).</p>
