</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The best way for an individual to learn a programming (or human language) is going to vary, but one of the fundamentals is you have to interact with it to really understand it. I will go over different methods and technologies I have used throughout this blog, but any success I've had has involved actually using with the language. Typing things out, seeing what happens if I try changing this or that, finding what makes it break. The same is true of human languages, you have to use it to really learn it, but I've got less experience with working with any other than English to have anything more meaningful to say at this point.</p>
<p>When I was first learning Javascript, I had a 5 hour flight, and I was going to be productive by reading a book on the subject. Usually I don't sleep well on planes, but I was out <em>really</em> quick on this particular flight. Nothing was wrong with the book, it's actually a really good one, but just reading about language syntax is incredibly dry. And you don't get a chance to start asking new questions or, more importantly, figuring out the answers.</p>
<p>You know the arguments you have with friends or family about who was in such and such movie? You will defend your rememberance fiercly, determined you are right. But sometimes you have to face up to the fact that you were wrong, and the movie about aliens starring Maggie Smith and Wilfred Brimley was not Predator. And that wasn't even Maggie Smith, it was Jessica Tandy. Well, learning to code is similar (no, really!). </p>
