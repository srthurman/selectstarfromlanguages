Some insights and reflections from the past week of learning.

###Java ADF
I've been tasked with creating an auto-complete street input for work, using Java as the backend. In researching possible ways to accomplish the task, I came across the Java Application Development Framework (ADF) from Oracle. It has many neat built in functions, including [autoSuggestBehavior](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23943_01/apirefs.1111/e12419/tagdoc/af_autoSuggestBehavior.html), which you can use to create an auto-complete input box. I went through this [autoSuggestBehavior tutorial](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/adf/learnmore/62-autosuggestbehavior-177811.pdf) using my own data, and got things somewhat working (e.g. it finally compiled, but didn't function correctly).

At that point, I had only invested a few hours in ADF, and thought it wise to see if my supervisor viewed ADF a good framework choice for the project. She did not, so I will leave things only somewhat working to pursue other options. If you're interested in learning more about ADF, which does have a solid base of built in functionality, check out this article on [why you should care about ADF](https://technology.amis.nl/2013/01/26/dear-javajee-developer-why-should-you-care-about-adf/).

###Learning Styles
Much can be gained by examining others learning habits. I'm looking at it in regards to programming and foreign languages specifically, but there are generalities that can be made regardless of the subject matter.

In reading several articles on the wonderful [Verbling blog](https://www.verbling.com/articles/), I've been struck by the variety of methods accomplished polyglots use, and also some of the consistent advice. Different methods (some used by the same person as their preference for learning style has evolved over time) include structured study up front, only speaking with others after a year or more, jumping right in with speech and trying to learn as you go, and spending a lot of time listening to the language before ever trying to learn words and grammar.

The overlap comes with the admonition to use a style that you enjoy, and to have fun! I know I can get trapped in the idea of finding the "best" way to do something, while ignoring that the best ultimately comes down to what I'll actually follow through with. Yes, some methods can deliver results quicker than others, but that doesn't matter if you never stick with it long enough to see results. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's a good reminder from people who are accomplished at learning human languages. The same holds true for learning computer languages, or anything really.
