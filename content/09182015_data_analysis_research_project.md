Summary: A research project for Wesleyans Data Management and Visualization course

I'm currently enrolled in Wesleyan's [Data Management and Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization) course through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). As part of the assignments, I'll be blogging on my research topic--posting updates and findings along with my process for analyzing the data.

Starting out, I was interested in studying the impact living in an urban area has on a population. Looking through the data available on [GapMinder](http://www.gapminder.org/), I've decided to focus on urbanization rates and gender equality. Specifically, is there an association between a country's level of urbanization and female education levels?

Urbanization is measured as the percentage of a nation's population living in urban areas. To evaluate education levels, I'm including the female literacy rate, the female primary school completion rate, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education. As each of these sources provides data across years and countries, it's possible to examine the urbanization-female education connection spatially and temporally. See my [Codebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zYf7P7lnjFMdVp6CCQV0t0TgFRBUfa7oz9TqIfaZSzY/edit?usp=sharing) for specific sources and more detailed definitions.

Reviewing available literature on the impact of urban life and urbanization patterns on gender equality in general, it seems the results can be a mixed bag. On the one hand:
> Urbanisation involves major shifts in the ways people work and live, and offers unprecedented opportunities for improved standards of living, higher life expectancy and higher literacy levels...
>

But urbanization can also produce negative outcomes, especially in developing countries where much of the new population growth occurs in "slums" (4). Since cities are more expensive than rural areas, and female labor continues to be less stable and have lower pay than men's, women in urban areas face greater economic stress (3,5).

As for female education levels, the overall effect of urbanization seems to be positive. There are a host of interrelated reasons for this finding: increased access to schools, a decreasing preference for male children, decreased fertility rates, and an increase of the age of first marriage, to name a few (1,2,3,5,6). Therefore, I expect to find that greater rates of urbanization will correspond with increases in female education levels, though the effect will be of differing magnitude between developing and highly industrialized countries.

####Summary

**Question**: Is there an association between a country's level of urbanization and female education levels?

**Hypothesis**: Greater rates of urbanization will correspond with increases in female education levels, though the effect will be of differing magnitude between developing and highly industrialized countries.
