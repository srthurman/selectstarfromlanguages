Hi, my name is Sara. I enjoy programming and travelling. By that measure, I also enjoy learning languages. Or attempting to. That's what this blog is about.


###Talking to Computers
I'm a self taught software developer. My primary interests are geospatial applications and web development.

I've dabbled in programming since the mid-2000's when I was in grad school at UVA. I started out with Visual Basic, making modifications to ESRI's desktop software, ArcGIS. When ArcGIS started to transition into Python, so did I, because Python is a much more fun language to work with than VB. Sorry VB. I didn't fully understand how Python worked when I started, but I managed to cobble together some scripts based off tutorials provided by ESRI and others.

Eventually my projects at work moved me into web mapping. My first attempt at writing code to make a map was with the ArcGIS API for Javascript, and at first, I was terrible. Terrible! I was taking example code, and trying to google my way to understanding enough to make the modifications I needed.

It really wasn't working. I needed a foundation in programming. I went back and started with Python since I was so frustrated working with Javascript. Once I started learning from the beginning, not just wading into the middle and struggling to comprehend anything, I was hooked. I started going to Meetups and finding all the online resources I could.

In the summer of 2014, I found out one of the programming branches in my office had an opening. The team was excited to bring me on board, which I would like to mainly attribute to their knowledge of my abilities and work ethic. However, that the federal hiring process is more akin to an H.P. Lovecraft tale of unyielding misery and horror could have played a part too. Regardless, one year after starting to seriously pursue programming, I had my first job as a professional developer!


###Talking to Humans
I started studying Spanish in 6th grade, and continued until senior year. At that time, I wasn't particularly interested in foreign languages, and I was terrible. Terrible! (Notice a theme?) For all the years I spent learning Spanish, I could have probably asked where the bathroom was, provided the other person also spoke English so I could just ask "Where is the bathroom?"

I started over with Spanish in college. This attempt was a little better, and the small bit of Spanish I remember now is from that time period. It still didn't grab me as something I would study on my own, but being able to start over made learning another language less daunting.

In 2012, m'lady (Significant other? "Roommate"? Friend with health-insurance benefits?) and I decided to go to Paris. We didn't want to show up as the ugly Americans, speaking not a word of the native tongue, so we tried our hand at learning enough French to get around. And guess what - it was fun! Learning for the sake of interacting with other humans was much more motivating than learning just to pass a test.

Since then we've had occasion to go to Montreal, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Each time we managed to learn a little bit of each countries primary language and it's made traveling that much more fun. Knowing just a little bit of a language takes away some of the anxiety of being in a place where you don't speak the language - because actually you do!

We haven't learned any of those languages to any sort of fluency, just enough to get by for a week. Starting in 2015, we decided to do more focused language learning. I'm starting with French since that was the first language I really had fun with, and from there, we'll have to see.
