Summary: Traveling and talking to developers in Portland and Seattle
Category: Weekly Roundup

After spending last weekend in Sonoma for a wedding, I traveled up the coast to visit Portland, OR and Seattle, WA. While in Portland, I was able to meet with some cool people and attend a tech networking event.

###Cool People
I reached out to two very nice people who work as developers in Portland, to see if I could meet with them and chat about their experiences while I was in town, and both of them were kind enough to take time out of their day to do so!
Jenny from [Metal Toad](http://www.metaltoad.com/) showed me around the office, told me about some of the work she does now, and shared her experience transitioning into tech from a non-tech background. Thanks Jenny!
[Mele](http://pdxmele.com/), whom I met at the State of the Map conference in DC, also shared how she transitioned into tech from a more GIS/geography background (like me), as well as discussions on Python, and what can make you a manager in short order (people skills). Thanks Mele!

###Keeping up with Tech
One question I put to both Jenny and Mele was "How do you keep up with technology?". The trends, new developments, new standards, etc. etc. The answer they both gave was basically "I don't". Not that they don't keep up with anything, they just don't try to keep up with ALL the things. Which was heartening to hear. It felt like that was a losing battle, and having two different professional developers say as much gave more credence to the idea.

Both women said there are spaces at work for people to post articles and information of possible interest. That way information can be shared, but in a more limited, focused way. And of course there are tech events (often meetups) where you end up learning new things. But the point is, you don't need to have some exhaustive list of resources and a detailed plan for how you're going to learn about every new tech topic to be able to stay up to date with what you need to know.

###Networking
I've been thinking about the hows and whys of networking lately. In trying to have a more long range view of my career, I realized I need to be meeting more people. It's not just about who might be able to connect you with a job, but also who you might be able to connect. Oh, you need an awesome front-end developer at your company? Well it just so happens I know one (or two or three)! Let's admit it, it feels good to our egos to be the match maker. For more on networking in general, I recommend the [Lady Loves Code podcast episode with Paul Watts](http://www.ladylovescode.com/2015/04/13/networking-and-karaoke-with-paul-watts/) and John Sonmez's site [Simple Programmer](http://simpleprogrammer.com/).

As luck would have it, there was a tech related networking event happening the Monday I was in Portland. [New Tech PDX - IoT edition](http://www.meetup.com/NewTechPDX/events/221190808/?a=co2_grp&gj=co2&rv=co2) was a great chance to talk to people working in all different sectors and with various backgrounds. I met a startup founder, a student at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/), a professional musician with a tech hobby, and many more.

I'll admit, it was a bit scary walking in at first, me being a pretty shy and introverted person. But the fact that the event was specifically for networking made it less of a mental hurdle. People wouldn't come to such an event (and especially wouldn't shell out $10) if they weren't interested in meeting others, right? Right! It was a great experience, and definitely bolstered my confidence to continue practicing talking with new people. If you're similarly shy, just get out there and try it. Especially if you're going to be out of your current place of residence. What have you got to lose really?
