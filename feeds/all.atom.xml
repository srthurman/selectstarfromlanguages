I started this a grand total of 5 days ago, so this isn't a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fluent Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main technique I'll be using is that outlined by Gabriel Wyner in his book and site &lt;a href="https://fluent-forever.com/"&gt;Fluent Forever&lt;/a&gt; (FF). The basic idea is that you first train your ears to hear your new language, then start learning a base vocabulary of 625 words using only pictures, no direct translation. From there you go on to grammar and making real, comprehensible sentences. All learning is based around using the spaced repetition learning technique, using the spaced repetition software (SRS) &lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;. Anki, aside from being free, is also open source and written in Python. I'll do a future post going into more detail, but if any of that is interesting to you, check out the &lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net/docs/addons.html"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; on creating add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute - why would you need to train your ears before diving into vocabulary? Because there are sounds you physically cannot hear currently! Your brain just can't distinguish them. And if you can't hear a certain sound, you certainly won't be able to make that sound when speaking. Not to mention the whole not being able to understand what other people are saying thing. Gabe goes into more detail in the book, and it's pretty interesting, at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest parts about FF is that Gabe sells pronunciation trainers and professional audio recordings of all 625 words in the base word list, but he also tells you exactly how to do it yourself. And he does so on the site, not just the book. The book goes into more detail, but you don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to get it to know what to do. Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole process can be totally free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create resources for a language FF doesn't cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the French pronunciation trainer and word list bundle. It was $20 and saves so much time. You can visit &lt;a href="https://fluent-forever.com/bundles/"&gt;the shop&lt;/a&gt; if you want to buy one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be supplementing this primary training with a podcast or two. The podcasts aren't for memorizing any specific words or grammar rules, but just for listening to French spoken more naturally, not just the isolated words of initial vocab training. I've been testing a few out, and so far I've liked &lt;a href="http://www.learnfrenchbypodcast.com/"&gt;Learn French by Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://radiolingua.com/coffeebreakfrench/"&gt;Coffee Break French&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Did you know that's possibly not that far off the mark? In many cases the push is to have the programming courses count as a math or science credit, but looking at (admittedly limited) evidence, it might make just as much sense to make it a language credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from several universities and other organizations took a peek inside programmers brains using an fMRI machine while they were reading code snippets. The results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a strong relation to language processing. To understand source code, participants had to process single words and symbols as well as statements that consist of single words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this is only one study, and the participants weren't actually writing code. By that measure it seems unsurprising that reading code would involve language processing. So perhaps adding Java or Python to the list of foreign languages offered is a bit premature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are detractors to the teaching of foreign languages in school at all. To those people, perhaps the substitution would make sense based on a more economic, what's going to give the most tangible benefit, viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this study seems to totally fail to teach people how to fluently speak foreign languages. So we can actually see in the data is that under 1 percent of Americans have learned to speak a foreign language very well in school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s pretty close to about one sixth of the time that students are spending in high school assuming that they start the foreign language in high school...And remember there is something else that students could be learning at that time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-Bryan Caplan of George Mason University (from episode 158 of the Freakonomics podcast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caplan doesn't talk about programming as the "something else", but that's certainly an option. And since English is already the lingua franca for many around the world, at least in business/professional contexts, learning to program could provide more financial benefits than knowing a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not actually advocating any particular position, I just found these data very interesting. And apropros for the first post. The questions of if we should be teaching kids to code, to speak a foreign language, and what the benefits of both may be are much bigger than this one post. But you reader (hi mom) are probably an adult, so you get to decide for yourself! Personal or professional, it's your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to know how many people that speak a foreign language are polyglots vs those that know programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank the CodeNewbie podcast and William Jeffries for providing the inspiration for this post. I hadn't heard of the fMRI research before William mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
