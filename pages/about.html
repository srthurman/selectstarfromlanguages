    <p>Hi, my name is Sara. I enjoy programming and travelling. By that measure, I also enjoy learning languages. Or attempting to. That's what this blog is about.</p>
<h3>Talking to Computers</h3>
<p>I'm a self taught software developer. Really I'm more of a web developer, but in my current job I do more than just web development.</p>
<p>I've dabbled in programming since the mid-2000's when I was in grad school at UVA. I started out with Visual Basic, making modifications to ESRI's desktop software ArcGIS. When ArcGIS started to transition into Python, so did I, because Python is a much more fun language to work with than VB. Sorry VB. I didn't fully understand how Python worked when I started, but I managed to cobble together some scripts based off tutorials provided by ESRI and others.</p>
<p>Eventually my projects at work moved me into web mapping. This was in my previous role as a Geographer, so I didn't have occasion to dive in too deep to programming, just as much as I needed. I started out with the ArcGIS API for Javascript. At first, I was terrible. Terrible! I had no idea where to declare a variable, or what a variable was even. I was taking example code, and trying to google my way to understanding enough to make the modifications I needed.</p>
<p>It really wasn't working. I needed a foundation in programming. I went back and started with Python since I was so frustrated working with Javascript. Once I started learning from the beginning, not just wading into the middle and struggling to comprehend anything, I was hooked. I started going to Meetups and finding all the online resources I could.</p>
<p>That was in the fall of 2013. In the summer of 2014, I found out one of the programming branches had an opening. I had worked with them before, so we all knew each other. They were excited to bring me on board. I would like to mainly attribute that to their knowledge of my abilities and work ethic, but that the federal hiring process is more akin to an H.P. Lovecraft tale of unyielding misery and horror probably played a part. Regardless, one year after starting to seriously pursue programming, I had my first job as a real life developer!</p>
<p>I'm having a great time as a professional. I like keeping side projects too, for all those interesting things that don't fit into my day job.</p>
<h3>Talking to Humans</h3>
<p>I started taking Spanish in 6th grade, and continued until 12th grade. My love of learning languages began at an early age. Just kidding, back then I hated it, and I was terrible. Terrible! (Notice a theme?) At that point I could have probably asked where the bathroom was, provided the other person also spoke English so I could ask "Where is the bathroom?"</p>
<p>I started over with Spanish in college since I had to take a language for my major. This was a little better, and the small bit of Spanish I remember now is from that class. It still didn't grab me as something I would like to study on my own, but being able to start from the top again made learning a new language less overwhelming.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 2012, when my sig-O and I decided to go to Paris that I ever enjoyed learning a language. It was the first time I was doing it because I wanted to rather than because I had to. We didn't want to show up as the ugly Americans, speaking not a word of the native tongue. It's a major European city, so most people do speak English, and would quickly switch upon hearing our labored attempts to make coherent sentences, but it was still pretty neat using the words and phrases we practiced at home with strangers. And people were very responsive to our efforts.</p>
<p>We had just learned enough to get by for a week, nothing coming close to fluency. But since then we've had occasion to go to Montreal (where we really had small occasion to use our small bit of French), Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Each time we managed to learn a little bit of each countries primary language and it's made traveling that much more fun. Knowing just a little bit of a language takes away some of the anxiety of being in a place where you don't speak the language - because actually you do!</p>
<p>We haven't learned any of those languages to any sort of fluency, just enough to get by for a week. Starting in 2015 we decided to start doing more focused language learning. I'm starting with French since that was the first language I really had fun with, and from there, we'll have to see.</p>
